# Overview

This is a local landmarks map for Lima, Peru. The map includes churches, historical sites, parks, temples, and viewpoints. The user can click on a marker to bring up information about the marker. There is a filter on the map for users to display only some of the markers.

My purpose for writing this software was to explore ArcGIS and mapping software.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code with the NeoVim extension to develop the software.

I used HTML/CSS and JavaScript for displaying and using the maps.

* I would like to improve the filtering as well.
